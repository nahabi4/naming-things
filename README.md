>There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.   
>*Phil Karlton*

- The variables or functions should be named by its work -: Name of variables/functions should always try to express their meaning without diving into the code base try to pack meaningful information inside the name.
- Naming should be simple enough to be understood by everyone -: Using complex words to describe a simple thing only creates hassle while reading the code.
- Prefer Concrete Names over Abstract Names -: Many possibilities create confusion using abstract names confuses readers.
- Don’t hesitate to use longer names -: We use short words even if it doesn’t provide full insight about the code which is a bad thing to do.
- Prepare yourself to make a mindset that you won’t be writing more comments now, your naming will provide an insight into the process.
